## Description

Tech Blog for users to create posts and interact with other people in the tech world.

## Installation

Handlebars, MySql, and Bcrypt to require login were used to create the application.

## Usage

The application is designed as a blog-site for a user to create news posts surrounding the tech world. The user can view and create posts. The user can also interact with other user's posts by commenting. Viewing posts and comments does not require a login, but if the user wishes to create their own post, or comment on any posts, they must login to do so. Upon account creation, the user will be allowed to view their dashboard, which will show their previous posts and allow them to create new ones. They can also click on their previous posts and be taken to that posts page, to view comments.
